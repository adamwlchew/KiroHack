# Coding Standards

## TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode for all code
- Explicitly type all function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object shapes rather than type aliases when possible
- Prefer readonly properties for immutable data
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Avoid using `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## React Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper component memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use React Context for state that needs to be accessed by many components
- Implement proper error boundaries

## API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for API endpoints
- Use consistent naming conventions (plural nouns for collections)
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Include pagination for collection endpoints
- Provide comprehensive error responses
- Version APIs appropriately

## Testing Requirements

- Maintain minimum 90% code coverage for unit tests
- Write integration tests for all API endpoints
- Include accessibility tests for all UI components
- Test for cross-platform compatibility
- Include performance tests for critical paths
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Accessibility Standards

- All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement proper semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers
- Support high contrast mode
- Implement reduced motion options

## Error Handling

- Use standardized error format across all services
- Implement proper logging with correlation IDs
- Use circuit breakers between services
- Define service-specific retry policies
- Provide graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Transform technical errors into user-friendly messages
